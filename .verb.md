## What is this?

This is a template helper that takes a `changelog` object, array, or filepath to a changelog file, and converts it to a markdown formatted changelog that looks something like this:

```
### [v0.2.0] - 2016-12-26

**fixed**

- Fixed [bug 10,997]

### [v0.1.0] - 2016-12-25

**deprecated**

- Deprecated `.foo` and `.bar`

**changed**

- Changed behavior of `.baz`
```

See [stringify-changelog][] for details.

## Usage

```js
var changelog = require('{%= name %}');
```

## API

```js
<%= changelog(value, locals) %>
```

### Params

- `value` **{String|Object|Array}**: If the value is a string it will be regarded as a filepath. Supported file formats are yaml, json, and markdown.
- `locals`: Locals or options to pass to [stringify-changelog][]. If a markdown file is passed, and it follows [keep-a-changelog][] conventions, the helper will attempt to generate [reflinks](#reflinks) to match the headings.

**Note**: When a filepath is passed, the _file name can be anything, but the extension is used for determining how to parse the file_:

```js
// file path to a valid yaml file
<%= changelog("CHANGELOG") %>
<%= changelog("CHANGELOG.yml") %>
<%= changelog("CHANGELOG.yaml") %>

// file path to a valid JSON file
<%= changelog("CHANGELOG.json") %>

// changelog object passed as a variable on the context
<%= changelog(changes) %>

// changelog object passed as locals
<%= changelog({ 
  "v0.1.0": { 
    date: "2016-12-26", 
    changes: [ "Got stuck in another chimney." ] 
  }
}) %>

// changelog array passed as locals
<%= changelog([
  {
    date: "2016-12-26", 
    version: "v0.1.0", 
    changes: [ "Got stuck in another chimney." ]
  }
]) %>
```

**YAML**

The contents of the file must be valid YAML following this format:

```yaml
v0.1.0:
  date: "2016-12-26"
  changes:
    - Got stuck in another chimney.
```
